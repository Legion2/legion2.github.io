I may not share everything here but you should get an overview over my interesting projects.

## List of Projects

- [**Somfy Remote Lib**](https://github.com/Legion2/Somfy_Remote_Lib)
  *An Arduino Library to emulate a Somfy remote using a 433.42 MHz transmitter.*

- [**Swagger UI Action**](https://github.com/Legion2/swagger-ui-action)
  *GitHub Action to automatically generate the Swagger UI from an OpenAPI document and deploy it to GitHub Pages*

- [**Open CUE CLI**](https://github.com/Legion2/open-cue-cli)
  *Command Line Interface to change iCUE profiles*

  It is very well documented and contains examples and features to improve the stability of the connection to iCUE.
  Instead of the cli also a [REST API](https://github.com/Legion2/open-cue-service) or an [MQTT client](https://github.com/Legion2/open-cue-mqtt) can be used to control iCUE profiles and integrate them into other systems.
  I use the MQTT client to control iCUE with the OpenHAB smarthome system.

- [**Corsair Lighting Protocol**](https://github.com/Legion2/CorsairLightingProtocol)
  *Control LEDs connected to an Arduino with iCUE*

  I started this project back in January 2019 by reverse engineering the Corsair Lighting NODE PRO LED controller and writing a proof of concept implementation for Arduino.
  Now it's an easy to use Arduino Library with many examples and good documentation.
  The functionality was extended to not only support the Lighting NODE PRO but also other Corsair devices.
  The library provide many utility functions to customize the LED controller.
- [**Leon Kiefer's project site**](https://github.com/Legion2/legion2.github.io)
  *My project site and blog hosted on GitHub Pages*
  
  On of my current project is to create my project site and start my own blog.
