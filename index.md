## List of Projects

- [**Open CUE CLI**](https://github.com/Legion2/open-cue-cli)
  *Command Line Interface to change iCUE profiles*

- [**Corsair Lighting Protocol**](https://github.com/Legion2/CorsairLightingProtocol)
  *Control LEDs connected to an Arduino with iCUE*

  I started this project back in January 2019 by reverse engineering the Corsair Lighting NODE PRO LED controller and writing a proof of concept implementation for Arduino.
  Now it's an easy to use Arduino Library with many examples and good documentation.
  The functionality was extended to not only support the Lighting NODE PRO but also other Corsair devices.
  The library provide many utility functions to customize the LED controller.
- [**Leon Kiefer's project site**](https://github.com/Legion2/legion2.github.io)
  *My project site and blog hosted on GitHub Pages*
  
  On of my current project is to create my project site and start my own blog.
