This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about), and it was inspired by [the /now movement](https://sivers.org/nowff).

I finished my masters degree and started working at voize GmbH.
As part of my job I try out new cool cloud-native technologies, such as kubernetes, Flux, distributed tracing and Quarkus.
