This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about), and it was inspired by [the /now movement](https://sivers.org/nowff).

I created my first [CLI tool](https://github.com/Legion2/open-cue-cli) and now trying to improve the backend service.
Therefore I'm trying to write my first C# project with C++ interoperability which exposes a HTTP REST API.
I'm also continue working on [Corsair Lighting Protocol](https://github.com/Legion2/CorsairLightingProtocol) an Arduino library to control lighting via iCUE.
