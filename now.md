This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about), and it was inspired by [the /now movement](https://sivers.org/nowff).

Currently I'm working on a DIY smart display powered by a Raspberry Pi and a touch display.
Therefore I created some MagicMirror Modules and helping to improve IoT projects.
I'm also continue working on [Corsair Lighting Protocol](https://github.com/Legion2/CorsairLightingProtocol) an Arduino library to control lighting via iCUE.
