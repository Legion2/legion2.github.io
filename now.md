This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about), and it was inspired by [the /now movement](https://sivers.org/nowff).

Currently I'm working on my own project site and [Corsair Lighting Protocol](https://github.com/Legion2/CorsairLightingProtocol) an Arduino library to control lighting via iCUE.
I try to get it to version 1.0.0.
