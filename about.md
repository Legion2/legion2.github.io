I'm Leon Kiefer a former student at University of Stuttgart.
I finished my masters degree in Software Engineering in 2021.
Currently I'm working at [voize](https://voize.de/) as Technical Lead.

I am passionate about working on open source projects.
My interests are Arduino DIY projects, IoT, software architecture, cloud-native technologies, enterprise applications, IT security and programming languages.

I believe in open source, so I provide all my projects as open source on GitHub.
