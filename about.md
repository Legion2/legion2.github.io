I'm Leon Kiefer a student at University of Stuttgart.
Currently working on my masters degree in Software Engineering.

I am passionate about working on open source projects.
My interests are Arduino DIY projects, IoT, software architecture, enterprise applications, IT security and programming languages.

I believe in open source, so I provide all my projects as open source on GitHub.
